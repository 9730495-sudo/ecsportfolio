  <div class="content">One of my favorite parts of life is food. There is such a big variety and you can explore so much with it. 
	  When I was younger, I did not appreciate the deliciousness of a good meal or snack, but as I have gotten older I most definiently do. 
	  I have a very big sweet tooth and I love to bake for me and my family and friends. When I am older I would love to do more things in the genre of food.</div>
